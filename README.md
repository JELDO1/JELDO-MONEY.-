Your repository's README file is typically the first item someone will see when visiting your repository. It usually contains information on what your project is about and why your project is useful.

As we learned in the Hello World tutorial, the README file (README.md) is written in Markdown syntax. Markdown is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write language for formatting plain text.

In this step, we'll edit your project's README.md using Markdown so that it includes some basic information about your project.

From the list of files, click README.md to view the file.

In the upper right corner of the file view, click  to open the file editor.

You will see that some information about your project has been pre-filled for you. For example, you should see the repository name and repository description you completed in Step 1 displayed on line 1 and line 2.
Delete the existing text apart from #, then type a proper title for your project.

Example: # About my first project on GitHub.
Next, add some information about your project, such as a description of the project's purpose or its main features.

Note

If you're not sure what to write, take a look at other repositories on GitHub to see how other people describe their projects.

To apply more sophisticated formatting, such as adding images, links, and footnotes, see Basic writing and formatting syntax
